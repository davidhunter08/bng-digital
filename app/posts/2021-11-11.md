description: Since beginning Alpha in July, the team have been exploring and validating the assumptions developed during Discovery. We have started looking at the technology which will underpin the Register, how users will add a site to the Register, as well as building our understanding of the Local Planning Authority (LPA) user journey and the Biodiversity Metric.

## Hello! 

As we mentioned in the [previous post](/2021-11-01), the [Alpha phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) for the BNG Digital Services Project started in July 2021, and as we are now in October, we wanted to share with you what has happened so far... 

## Introductions 

July was all about introductions. New team members from Defra’s Digital Data and Technology Services (DDTS) joined us, and we spent some time getting to know each other, getting to know the project space, and building shared understanding of the project objectives.  

Not only did we get the chance to meet our new team members (albeit virtually), we also had the opportunity to introduce ourselves and the project to some of the future users of the Digital Services! We have had over 150 people express an interest in participating in the user research and testing for the Biodiversity Gain Site Register and the Credit Sales Service, so we ran some introductory webinars to tell everyone a little bit more about the project and what they had signed up for.  

It was then time to dive in and really begin Alpha… 

## Understanding the Register Service 

To better understand the future Register service and the technology that will underpin it, the team focused on the key users and processes, determining what information would be needed on the Register, and the services needed to support it. Our tech leads have also begun to understand the potential to reuse and join up with existing Government services which could support functions within the Register, such as [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/) for processing registration fees.   

## Register a Biodiversity Gain Site 

One of the first things the team explored was how future users will register a biodiversity gain site. We investigated what data will go into the register and built a basic prototype to test with users, and observe how they navigate through it.

This gave us an initial insight into what could work for our users, and which parts of the prototype we needed to rethink, to inform the next prototype for testing.  

## Understanding the LPA journey 

Our focus then shifted to exploring the work of LPAs and the planning process, and where BNG and the Register will fit within the planning application journey. We conducted ten 1-2-1 sessions with LPA staff, presenting them with a map of what we understood to be their existing journey through the planning application process, gathering their thoughts on what works, and where the pain points are. This helped us better understand their personal experiences of the journey, where the Register will fit into it, and will inform future Register prototypes. 

## Understanding and Extracting Data from the Biodiversity Metric  

The [Biodiversity Metric](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/biodiversity-30-metric-launched-in-new-sustainable-development-toolkit) is a key tool for applying BNG and an important data source for the Register, with many users emphasising how crucial it is to their overall BNG journey.  

One area we were keen to look at was how data can be pulled from the Metric into the Register. Data extraction from the metric is possible, but there is still a lot of work to do to ensure we get this right. The team have also been investigating how this can be done securely, and what the accessibility requirements may be.

In addition to this, the team have been building their understanding of how LPAs, developers and ecologists use the metric, and how this will influence the Register service.  

## What’s happening next?  

We will be continuing to ask questions and explore how we can best build these digital services to meet the needs of future users and legislation. We’re extremely grateful for everyone who has participated in user research so far and are looking forward to engaging with more of you soon.  

If you haven’t already expressed an interest in participating in the user research but would like to, please do let us know!
